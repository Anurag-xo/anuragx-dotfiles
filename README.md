# ðŸ¦‚ Anurag's Dotfiles

My personal development environment, fully automated for a quick and seamless setup on any new machine. This repository contains all the configuration files and installation scripts for my terminal, editor, and command-line tools.

The setup is designed to be idempotent and robust, meaning you can run the installer multiple times without causing issues.
